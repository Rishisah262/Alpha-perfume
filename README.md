To recreate the perfume store website for Alpha, I applied a combination of HTML, CSS, and responsive design techniques to ensure a visually appealing and functional layout. The process involved several key steps:

1. Structuring the Website with HTML
I began by building a semantic HTML structure, ensuring clear separation between different sections. The header contains a navigation menu with links and a call-to-action button, while the hero section is divided into two halves—one for text and a button, and the other for an image. I incorporated the Alpha logo using the provided URL and optimized the navigation for better accessibility.

2. Enhancing Visual Appeal with CSS
Using CSS, I implemented modern design principles such as flexbox and grid to ensure alignment and spacing. I chose a font style that complements the brand’s identity and ensured that the buttons and text contrast well with the background. To maintain a premium look, I added padding, margins, and hover effects.

3. Ensuring Responsiveness
Since the website needs to work across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, I applied media queries to adjust font sizes, image scaling, and layout stacking. The navigation and hero section dynamically adjust based on screen width, providing a seamless experience.

4. Optimizing Performance and Usability
Icons from Font Awesome were used to enhance the UI without affecting page load speed. The image and button elements were carefully positioned to follow UI/UX best practices, making interactions smooth and user-friendly.

By leveraging my expertise in front-end development, I successfully recreated a clean, modern, and fully responsive perfume store layout that aligns with Alpha’s brand identity.
